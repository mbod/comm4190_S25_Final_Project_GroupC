    "  - Introduce yourself.\n",
    "  - Ask about their age, health conditions, and past/future healthcare usage.\n",

    "  - Ask if they have follow-up questions.\n",

    "Capabilities:\n",
    " - Reference documents to support answers.\n",
    " - Use RAG and web search when needed.\n",

      "A copay is a fixed fee you pay for medical services as part of your health insurance coverage. Learn how copays work, how they differ from deductibles and coinsurance, and how they affect your insurance premiums. A co-pay is a fixed fee for specific medical services or prescriptions that policyholders share with insurers. Learn how co-pays vary by plan, provider, and service, and how to dispute errors or discrepancies. Copay is a fixed amount you pay for medical services covered by your insurance policy. Learn how copays are determined, regulated, and resolved, and how they affect your healthcare utilization and costs. A copay is a fixed dollar amount that you pay for certain in-network services. Except on services that have copays, a deductible is the amount you pay for in-network healthcare before your health insurance begins to pay for covered services. Here's what you need to know when it comes to health insurance copays and other out-of-pocket costs. Introduction to Copayments Copayments are a common term in health insurance, but what exactly do they mean? In simple terms, a copayment, or copay, is a fixed amount that you pay out of pocket for covered healthcare services.\n",
