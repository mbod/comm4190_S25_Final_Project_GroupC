## COMM5190 (Spring 2025) Final Project

### Project Group C: HealthPlan Helper

----

Health insurance information can be overwhelming. During open enrollment, people are presented with a wealth of different plan options and need to make a decision, even though they can't perfectly predict what their healthcare needs will be over the next year. In addition, health plan information often includes confusing terminology and the number of different plans to choose between is sometimes overwhelming. HealthPlan Helper is here to help! 

Using retrieval-augmented generation, HealthPlan Helper will read the plan brochures to learn about what your choices are. Then, it will guide you through a data-driven decision process. Using basic information about your health status and your healthcare usage over the previous year, while also understanding that unexpected things occur sometimes, it will predict what healthcare services you might require over the next year. Then, combining this estimate with your plan brochures, it will make a recommendation about which plans would best serve you. Finally, it will be ready to answer any questions you may have about the plans as well as health insurance in general.
